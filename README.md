# Live-chat-app

The live chat app is built with react and chatengine.io, it enables users chat in real time. Users are expected to sign up before they can have access to chat on live-chat-app. Temporarily, the sign up feature isn't functional. There are 3 already created users for testing :

## USERS
1. username:Femi  password:femi
2. username:Motun  password:motun
3. username:Xyluz  password:xyluz

There's an option to create a chatroom and add fellow users to any chatroom of your choice, User Femi is the admin and only that user can exercise this feature. Chatrooom can also be deleted and renamed.

As it stands, there are 2 chatrooms:

## CHATROOOMS
1. announcement - This chatroom has two users( Femi and Motun).
2. random - This chatroom also has two users (Femi and Xyluz).

PS: Chatrooms can have as many users as possible.
