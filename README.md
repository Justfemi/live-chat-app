# Live-chat-app

The live chat app is built with react and chatengine.io, it enables users chat in real time. Users are expected to sign up before they can have access to chat on live-chat-app. Temporarily, the sign up feature isn't functional. There are 3 already created users for testing :

## USERS
1. username:Femi  password:femi
2. username:Motun  password:motun
3. username:Xyluz  password:xyluz

There's an option to create a chatroom and add fellow users to any chatroom of your choice, every user can do this but only tha admin(Femi) can delete Chatroooms.

As it stands, there are 3 chatrooms:

## CHATROOOMS
1. announcement - This chatroom has all the users( Femi, Motun and Xyluz).
2. frontend has Femi and Xyluz.
3. general has only Motun and Xyluz.

PS: Chatrooms can have as many users as possible.
